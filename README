Laborantin is a measurement batch facilitator.
When you need to perform a lot of measurements varying some parameters, Laborantin helps you to stay organized.
It provides an abstraction of environments and scenarii, vary all possible parameters and store everything in directories.

Next, it will ease the reprocessing of measurements, synchronization to send reports to a backup server, and maybe provide some coordination with distant nodes.
